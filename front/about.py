        <p>Snakebites are a significant global health issue, particularly in rural and impoverished regions of tropical and subtropical countries. The World Health Organization (WHO) recognizes snakebite envenoming as a neglected tropical disease. Estimates suggest that there are approximately <strong>5.4 million snakebite cases annually, leading to between 81,000 and 138,000 deaths.</strong> Additionally, about <ins>400,000 survivors suffer from serious sequelae, including amputations, renal failure, and psychological trauma.</ins></p>

    # Regions Most Affected
    st.markdown("""
        <h3>Regions Most Affected üêç</h3>
        <p>The burden of snakebites is disproportionately borne by communities in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. In these regions, access to medical care is limited, and antivenom, the primary treatment, may be scarce, unaffordable, or ineffective against local snake venoms. India, with its diverse snake population, reports the highest number of snakebite deaths. Sub-Saharan Africa also faces a significant snakebite burden, with many cases going unreported.</p>

    # Economic and Social Consequences
    st.markdown("""
        <h3>Economic and Social Consequences üí∏</h3>
        <p>The impact of snakebites extends beyond health. Survivors often face significant economic hardships due to loss of livelihoods and the cost of treatment. In many cultures, victims may also experience social stigmatization. The economic burden on families and healthcare systems is compounded by the lack of affordable and effective treatment options.</p>

        <h3>üöÄ Technologies Employed</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Machine Learning & AI: Utilizes the FastAI learning model on top of the ResNet architecture to create a customized offline model for precise snake detection. Over 100,000 images were used to train this extensive model. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eRcUwWEXfuFvDOZ-vlBtIYctBbL_xI6W/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Download model here</a></li>
            <li>Online Ready: Since the online platforms currently support smaller models for free hosting, we use custom developed Ultralytics YOLO model for cloud enabled online real-time, accurate detection of snake presence and species classification, harnessing custom-trained models based on extensive datasets scraped from across the web.</li>
            <li>Geolocation & Mapping API: Integrates Google Maps API for seamless navigation to the nearest healthcare facilities capable of snakebite treatment, directly from the user's location.</li>
            <li>Natural Language Processing: Employs OpenAI's latest language model for instant, reliable first aid guidance, enhancing user interaction and knowledge dissemination.</li>
            <li>Streamlit Web Application: A user-friendly interface that democratizes access to life-saving snakebite information and resources, designed for widespread use across varied geographical and socio-economic landscapes.</li>
